# outdated
This is a public fork, I like to look at seconb's code and contribute at times. This is not a repo you should be getting the colorbot off of. Please go to the [Offical Repo](https://github.com/Seconb/Roblox-Colorbot)
I have a version of this [colorbot in C#](https://github.com/TaylorIsBlue/Csharp-Colorbot), which may be easier to read for some. It will not be updated regularly, and is simply a conversion with organized code.
